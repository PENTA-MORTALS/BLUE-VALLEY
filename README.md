## Long description 

### About

Blue valley was created based on one of the most serious problems related to water, that is, water scarcity. Across the world even in tropical countries like India, drinking water or water needed for households is so scarce or at least it does not reach the public in an effective manner. Blue Valley aims to eradicate such troubles and bring water required for any household purposes to your doorstep.

### Implementation

We have tied up with the best local companies which provide the water. Our teams choose them after various levels of testing because we really want to give the customers the best. We like to be very transparent with our customers therefore, the quality of water provided by them is provided along the cost of each liter in parts per million (ppm). Blue valley further aims to tie up with companies as local as possible so that we can reach our customers quickly.

### Design

Blue valley website is designed with a highly responsive layout using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. The layout is very simple and user-friendly. We have mentioned every aspect of our website in all our pages which enables our users to connect and know about us. The colors chosen were very carefully picked to give the users a satisfied experience throughout the website. We have used IBM Watson as our Chabot to facilitate the user experience to another whole level. We plan on improving our design in the future to fit the needs.

### Dashboard

One of the pages is the personal dashboard of a household using it. We keep track of the amount of water used by them which automatically makes them conscious about the amount of water they use which directly leads to them taking steps to conserve water. This initiative will surely lead to conservation of not just water bodies but also the marine ecosystem. It is sure to bring a higher degree of awareness among the future generation.

### The Future

As for the development of the Blue Valley we are interested in extending our project all around the world because this exists around the globe. We would also like to bring a lot of young innovators into this process. We are planning to do this, the reasons for water scarcity are more the very poor management of governing bodies. For example, the ample use of fresh water by the industries and their improper disposal of waste into it again. Their innovations are sure to amplify the direct results of using Blue Valley and  "Make the world the best place to live in" as mentioned before.

### Conclusion

So we the team behind Blue Valley are budding software developers with so much aspiration to bring about a change in the society. When we came across this competition, we up-skilled ourselves along the way to provide a professional website. The tutoring and help that we received from the Slack channel of "Call for Code" played a very important role in presenting such a result. So we would be really happy if we could collaborate with IBM to improve our career further.
